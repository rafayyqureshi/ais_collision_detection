# AIS Collision Detection System
## Block 1: Project Setup & ML Architecture Design
### Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

This document presents the implementation of Block 1 of the AIS Collision Detection System project. Block 1 focuses on establishing the development environment and designing the machine learning architecture for the system. The deliverables include a containerized development environment with ML toolkit, comprehensive ML architecture diagrams, data flow models for prediction pipelines, model lifecycle management framework, and integration strategy documentation.

**Implementation Duration:** 10 hours  
**Cost:** $80 (completed block)
